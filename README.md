Industrial AI: Affordance Theory & Computer Vision üöÄ
Project Overview
A groundbreaking implementation combining advanced computer vision with cognitive psychology's affordance theory to create an intelligent industrial assistance system. The project bridges the gap between object detection and contextual understanding in manufacturing environments.

Core Innovation üî¨
The system's novelty lies in its fusion of:

Zero-shot object detection (OWL-ViT model)
Gibson's affordance theory implementation
Large Language Model reasoning (GPT-4)
Theoretical Foundation üìö
Affordance Theory Integration
Gibson's Theory: Objects suggest their potential uses through their physical characteristics
Implementation: Mathematical mapping of industrial objects to possible actions
Enhancement: AI-driven context understanding of object relationships
Computer Vision Architecture
Model: OWL-ViT (Object-centric Vision Transformer)
Advantages:
Zero-shot detection capability
No pre-training required for new objects
Industrial domain adaptation
